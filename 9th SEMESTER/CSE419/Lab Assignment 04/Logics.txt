1) The answer is simple. Given the gcd and lcm, if the gcd can be divided by the lcm, there exists 2 numbers, otherwise not. If there exists 2 numbers, there can be many pairs among them. But the simplest pair is the (gcd, lcm). Because, 
max value of gcd = min(two numbers) and min value of lcm = max(two numbers)


2) we first used Sieve of Erathosthenes in numbers upto x. Then manually check using a for loop, that which two prime numbers sum upto x.


3) we first used Sieve of Erathosthenes in numbers upto 20000000. Then add only those primes in a vector, whose difference with next prime is 2. After that for every test cases, we simply printed that index of that vector. 


4) first we are finding and storing all the divisors of the given number in a vector. then simply testing out all possible pairs of the divisors. 


5) first we keep all the prime numbers upto the given number in a vector. then just simply print the middle prime numbers. easy pizi.
