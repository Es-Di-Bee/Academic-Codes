1) The input distribution can be skewed. That is why it is better to use median than to use average. 

2) the answer is brute force. First, find out all possible sums and then just compare. 

3) Simple plain binary search for less time complexity

4) Divide the received money in half. And then binary search all the possible pair of numbers (which sums up to the received money). 

5) can be solved easily using the upper bound and lower bound. Upper bound provides the first index whose value is greater than a given value in an array, and lower bound provides the first index whose value is not less than a given value in an array. 

6) we used binary search on the answer range. And checked if the ans is right, in brute force method.
